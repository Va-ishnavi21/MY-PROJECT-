This Python script impliments a basic pipeline for retrieving relevant information from a PDF and generating answers to user queries using a combination of machine learning tools.
* Extracting text from PDF
* chunking text
* Embedding and storing text
* Query handling
* Response generation
  
Key Technologies
* PyPDF2 : Extracts text from PDF files.
* SentenceTransformers : Generates vector embedding for text.
* FAISS : Efficiently stores and retrieves embedding for similarity search.
* OpenAIv API : Generates responses using GPT models.
This pipelines efficiently handles document ingestion, retrieval and natural language query answering.
